Welcome to the frontier of quantitative investing! This is a stock trading research tool using cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, multivariate prediction models like VAR, and valuable economic data. You can think of it as an AI financial expert.

## Ingredients
### Large Language Models (LLMs)
We leverage the power of LLMs to extract insights and sentiment from a wealth of data. Lots of models tested including Claude 3 Sonnet, Llama 2 7B, Gemini 1.0 Pro, all deployed in Vertex AI's model garden.

### FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
This project incorporates economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to understand the broader economic landscape. Interest rates, inflation, and other factors can significantly impact stock market behavior, and the code leverages deep industry research on macro-economic resilience.

### Senator Data
By leveraging webscraping, we gather the latest senator trading decisions. This allows us to trade on top of the giants.
