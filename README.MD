# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Trading Bot with LLMs and Economic Insights
Welcome to the frontier of quantitative investing! This project delves into the exciting world of building a stock trading bot using cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and valuable economic data.

## Ingredients
### Large Language Models (LLMs)
We leverage the power of LLMs to extract insights and sentiment from a wealth of data.

### FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
This project incorporates economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to understand the broader economic landscape. Interest rates, inflation, and other factors can significantly impact stock market behavior.

### Senator Data
By leveraging webscraping, we gather the latest senator trading decisions. This allows us to trade on top of the giants.

### Python
Python provides the foundation for building our trading bot. Its rich ecosystem of libraries allows us to wrangle data, train LLMs, and make informed trading decisions.
